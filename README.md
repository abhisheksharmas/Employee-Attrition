# Employee-Attrition
Employee Attrition Prediction
Overview
This project focuses on predicting employee attrition using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning models. The goal is to identify factors that contribute to employee turnover and build a predictive model to help organizations take proactive measures.

Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed the dataset to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights about employee attrition.

Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and removed irrelevant features.

Machine Learning Models: Implemented and evaluated models such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, and SVM to predict attrition.

Performance Metrics: Used confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score to assess model performance.

Dataset
The dataset used is HR-Employee-Attrition.csv, which contains 35 features related to employee demographics, job satisfaction, work environment, and attrition status.

Results
The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of XX% (replace with actual accuracy).

Key factors influencing attrition were identified (e.g., job satisfaction, work-life balance, etc.).

Tools and Technologies
Python

Pandas, NumPy (Data Manipulation)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)
